  <p class="intro-blurb">The following poster was prepared for the 2020 UVM Student Research Conference. I participated in the general poster session, in which researchers alternated touring the hall and presenting their work. To facilitate the mixed format, the poster is designed to represent itself but admit verbal accompaniment.</p>
