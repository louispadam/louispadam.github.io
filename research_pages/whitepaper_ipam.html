  <p class="intro-blurb">The following whitepaper was produced in the culminating week of the long-program: <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/bridging-the-gap-transitioning-from-deterministic-to-stochastic-interaction-modeling-in-electrochemistry/?tab=overview">Bridging the Gap: Transitioning from Deterministic to Stochastic Interaction Modeling in Electrochemistry</a>. It summarizes research done over the three-month program. Projects were initially distributed between a collection of specialized working groups, each of which contributed a section to the white paper. I was most involved in the work discussed in Section 3.</p>
