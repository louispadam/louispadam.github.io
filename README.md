# Version 1.00 of Adam Petrucci's Personal Website

All content is original. This includes text, icons, and images.

I would like to extend a special thanks to freeCodeCamp. They provided ample resources for learning to code with HTML and CSS. The skills I developed through their Responsive Web Design Certification were instrumental in producing this website.
