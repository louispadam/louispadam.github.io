  <header class="intro-blurb">
    <p>My most recent research interests are in the realm of applied partial differential equations. The transition from particle systems to continuum mechanics via mean-field limits features most prominently. I am also interested in bifurcation analysis, particularly in the behavior of bifurcation points as models transition between variants dominated by different modes. Both projects are part of my graduate work at Michigan State University (MSU).</p>
    <p>Prior to pursuing a doctoral degree, I conducted research in water-sustainability policy as a data scientist and differential algebra as a Masters student in mathematics. The former resulted in a publication. The latter was, unfortunately, left incomplete in the transition from my undergraduate institution, the University of Vermont, to graduate school (UVM).</p>
    <p>The bulk of my undergraduate research was in chemistry, particularly analytic and physical fields. My undergraduate thesis focused on the photophysical mechanisms of organic molecules exhibiting anomalous fluorescence. I also investigated the potential field-use of a novel extraction method for semivolatile aerosols and participated in a project exploring the introduction of machine learning techniques to the curricula of courses in computational chemistry.</p>

      <h2>Mean-Field Analysis of Yeast Metabolism</h2>
      <div class="research-flex">
        <p>Yeast metabolism exhibits an asymmetric, nonlocal, spatially inhomogeneous interaction between agents that produces complex dynamics in both the particle and continuum settings. With that said, derivation of the continuum solution, characterized by a partial differential equation (<abbr>PDE</abbr>), as the limiting behavior of the particle system, a collection of coupled ordinary differential equations (<abbr>ODEs</abbr>), remains open. Preliminary numerical simulations actually suggest the models exhibit qualitatively different behavior. This is of relevance to both the biological aim of understanding temporal clustering observed in in yeast cutlures and the mathematical aim of better understanding mean-field limits, or deviations thereof.</p>
        <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_yeast.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>Rigorous derivation of this mean-field limit, or proof of its failure, is the primary objective of my doctoral thesis. Under the supervision of <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/promislo/">Dr. Keith Promislow</a>, I have developed numerical schemes for accurate simulation of both particle and continuum models and characterized the interaction kernel as outside the scope of current mean-field literature. Current avenues of investigation include the spectral stability of stationary and temporally periodic solutions, generalization of our numerical scheme to higher-dimension Vlasov-type equations, and the machine-learning of error terms in the BBGKY hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Early results of the project have been presented at the Amsterdam Centre for Dynamics and Computations Autumn School (<a href="/research_pages/poster_acdc.html">poster available here</a>), and a more general discussion of novel mean-field analysis was presented at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (<abbr>IPAM</abbr>).</p>

      <h2>Mean-Field Modeling in Electrochemistry</h2>
      <div class="research-flex">
        <p>The high-dimensional nature of electrochemical settings poses a challenge to the design of computationally tractable models. The so-called ground-truth, atomistic simluations, are too computationally expensive for realistic simulations. Mean-field models reduce computational demand, but can fail to capture the singular events responsible for salient electrochemical phenomena. The Insitute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (<abbr>IPAM</abbr>) hosted a research program, `Bridging the Gap: Transitioning from Deterministic to Stochastic Interaction Modeling in Electrochemistry' to investigate the transition from particle to continuum models and develop a novel solution to the problem of electrochemical modeling.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Over the course of a three-month program, I participated in a working group developed and implemented a novel, preliminary mean-field model for simulating the electrochemical behavior of water. Participants included students and associates of Drs. <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/promislo/">Dr. Keith Promislow</a>, and <a href="https://thorntongroup.engin.umich.edu/">Katsuyo Thornton</a>, and <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/">Chris Andersen</a>. My principle contributions was in the design and implementation of a numerical scheme, pairing a pseudospectral approach with dimension-splitting, to simulate the new model.</p>
      <p>As part of end-of-program presentations, both the model and simulations were presented at a culminating retreat. I presented the latter.</p>

      <h2>Photophysics of Anomalous Stokes Shifts</h2>
      <div class="research-flex">
        <p>Stokes shifts serve as one of the most important indicators of a molecules potential in light-emitting technologies. In brief, small Stokes shifts admit aggregation-caused quenching (<abbr>ACQ</abbr>), a phenomenon by which luminescent materials effectively disabled. This precludes their application in such burgeoning technological fields as fluorescence-based medical imaging and organic light-emitting diodes (<abbr>OLEDs</abbr>). The discovery of organic molecules with large Stokes shifts promises to surmount the challenge and broaden the field of candidates for technological application.</p>
        <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_stokes.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>The greatest achievement of my undergraduate journey was elucidating the mechanism for large Stokes shifts in triazolopyridinium and triazoloquinolinium dyes. Collaborating with Drs. Morgan Cousins (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-cousins/">her LinkedIn</a>) and <a href="https://mliptak.w3.uvm.edu/">Matthew Liptak</a>, I conducted computational chemical analysis using the ORCA-implementation of density functional theory. This led to a novel mechanism for large Stokes shifts based on the inversion of aromatic stability upon excitation.</p>
      <p>The project was presented at an annual UVM Student Research Confernce (<a href="/research_pages/poster_toptoq.html">poster available here)</a> and included in my undergraduate thesis: <cite>Petrucci, Adam N., "<a href="https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/castheses/93/">Modeling of Photophysical Phenomena: Anomalies to Kasha's Rule and Conventional Stokes Shifts</a>" (2021). UVM College of Arts and Sciences College Honors Theses. 93.</cite>. Finally, I am most proud of the peer-reviewed publication of my research, <cite>Adam N. Petrucci, Morgan E. Cousins, Matthew D. Liptak, “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04397">Beyond 'Mega': Origin of the 'Giga' Stokes Shifts of Triazolopyrdiniums</a>.” J. Phys. Chem. B, 2022, 126: 6997-7005</cite>.</p>

      <h2>Aggregation-Induced Emissions by the Suppression of Relaxation Pathways</h2>
      <div class="research-flex">
        <p>Aggregation-induced emission (<abbr>AIE</abbr>) offers means of preserving photophysical properties in solid or aggregated states. As the converse to ACQ (<a href="#stokes">discussed above</a>), this is particularly relevant to the development of organic OLEDs and sustainable electronics. Moreover, in the photophysics community, ACQ has long been accepted as standard behavior AIE as only a rarity. In consequence, AIE is not only of practical use, but also of great academic interest.</p>
        <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_sokr.png"/>
      </div>   
      <p>Investigation of the Suppression of Kasha's Rule (<abbr>SOKR</abbr>) as a photophysical mechanism for AIE inaugurated my undergraduate research career. <a href="https://mliptak.w3.uvm.edu/">Dr. Matthew Liptak</a> and then-graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-cousins/">Morgan Cousins</a> mentored me in the use of absorbance and fluorescence spectrometries, paired with computational experiments, to elucidate photophysical phenomena. The project also implemented nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the photo-induced isomerization of the principal molecul of interest, diphenyl hexatriene.</p>
      <p>The results of this project were presented at the Champlain Area Chemistry Symposium, (<a href="research_pages/poster_dph.html">poster available here</a>) and included in my undergraduate honors thesis: <cite>Petrucci, Adam N., "<a href="https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/castheses/93/">Modeling of Photophysical Phenomena: Anomalies to Kasha’s Rule and Conventional Stokes Shifts</a>" (2021).

      <h2>Solid-Phase Microextraction for Collection of Sugarcane Emissions</h2>
      <div class="research-flex">
        <p>Secondary organic aerosols (<abbr>SOA</abbr>s) significantly alter fluids' optical properties. This has proven a challenge at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<abbr>NASA</abbr>) research and launch sites, which are often situated in isolated areas used for the cultivation of SOA-emitting crops, such as sugar cane. The technique of Solid-phase microextraction (<abbr>SPME</abbr>) was developed to facilitate on-site collection of SOA samples.</p>

      <p>The Organic Aerosol Research Studies (<abbr>OARS</abbr>) Laboratory at the University of Vermont, headed by <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cas/chemistry/profile/giuseppe-joe-petrucci">Dr. Giuseppe Petrucci</a>, specializes in analytic atmospheric chemistry and hosted me as an intern. Under the tutelage of then-graduate student Rebecca Harvey (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-harvey-wel/">her LinkedIn</a>). I quantified the efficacy of SPME using coupled gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (<abbr>GCMS</abbr>). This served as the culminating project in my membership of Essex High School's STEM Academy and the beginning of my journey in academic research.</p>
