    <p>My graduate research is in applied partial differential equations, with particular attention to the transition from particle systems to continuum mechanics via mean-field limits. I am also engaged in bifurcation analysis, examining the behavior of bifurcation points as models transition between variants dominated by different modes. Both projects involve numerical simulation and form part of my graduate work at Michigan State University (MSU).</p>
    <p>Prior to pursuing a doctoral degree, I conducted research in water-sustainability policy as a data scientist and in differential algebra as a master's student in mathematics. The former resulted in a publication. The latter was unfortunately cut short by the transition from my undergraduate institution, the University of Vermont (UVM), to graduate school.</p>
    <p>The bulk of my undergraduate research was in chemistry, particularly in analytic and physical fields. My thesis investigated the photophysical mechanisms of organic molecules exhibiting anomalous fluorescence. I also developed protocols for the field use of a novel extraction method for semivolatile aerosols and explored the integration of machine learning techniques into computational chemistry curricula.</p>

      <h2>Mean-Field Analysis of Yeast Metabolism</h2>
      <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_yeast.png"/>
      <p>Yeast metabolism exhibits an asymmetric, nonlocal, spatially inhomogeneous interactions between agents that produces complex dynamics in both the particle and continuum settings. The particle system is modeled by a collection of coupled ordinary differential equations (<abbr>ODE</abbr>s) while the continuum solution is characterized by a partial differential equation (<abbr>PDE</abbr>). The derivation of this continuum solution as the limiting behavior of the particle system is an open problem. Preliminary numerical simulations suggest the models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior, although quantifying a rate of convergence remains challenging. This is of relevance to both the biological aim of understanding temporal clustering observed in yeast cultures and the mathematical aim of better understanding mean-field limits and their deviations.</p>
      <p>Investigation of this mean-field limit and characterization of its dependencies is the primary objective of my doctoral thesis. Under the supervision of <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/promislo/" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Promislow</a>, I have developed numerical schemes for accurate simulation of both particle and continuum models and identified the interaction kernel as outside the scope of current mean-field literature. Current avenues of investigation include the spectral stability of stationary and temporally periodic solutions, generalization of our numerical scheme to higher-dimensional Vlasov-type equations, and the application of machine-learning to approximate error terms in the BBGKY hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Early results of this project were presented at the Amsterdam Centre for Dynamics and Computations Autumn School (<a href="/research_pages/poster_acdc.html">poster available here</a>), and a broader discussion of novel mean-field analyses was presented at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (<abbr>IPAM</abbr>).</p>

      <h2>Mean-Field Modeling in Electrochemistry</h2>
      <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_echem.png"/>
      <p>The high-dimensional nature of electrochemical settings poses a challenge to the design of computationally tractable models. The so-called ground-truth, atomistic simluations, are too computationally expensive for realistic simulations. Mean-field models reduce computational demand, but can fail to capture the singular events responsible for salient electrochemical phenomena. The Insitute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (<abbr>IPAM</abbr>) hosted a research program, <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/bridging-the-gap-transitioning-from-deterministic-to-stochastic-interaction-modeling-in-electrochemistry/?tab=overview" target="_blank">Bridging the Gap: Transitioning from Deterministic to Stochastic Interaction Modeling in Electrochemistry</a> to investigate the transition from particle to continuum models and develop a novel solution to the problem of electrochemical modeling.</p>
      <p>Over the course of a three-month program, I participated in a working group developed and implemented a novel, preliminary mean-field model for simulating the electrochemical behavior of water. Participants included students and associates of Drs. <a href="https://users.math.msu.edu/users/promislo/" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Promislow</a>, and <a href="https://thorntongroup.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Katsuyo Thornton</a>, and <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/">Chris Andersen</a>. My principle contributions was in the design and implementation of a numerical scheme, pairing a pseudospectral approach with dimension-splitting, to simulate the new model.</p>
      <p>As part of end-of-program presentations, both the model and simulations were presented at a culminating retreat, and results were summarized in a <a href="/research_pages/whitepaper_ipam.html">white paper</a>.</p>

      <h2>Photophysics of Anomalous Stokes Shifts</h2>
      <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_stokes.png"/>
      <p>Stokes shifts serve as one of the most important indicators of a molecules potential in light-emitting technologies. In brief, small Stokes shifts admit aggregation-caused quenching (<abbr>ACQ</abbr>), a phenomenon by which luminescent materials effectively disabled. This precludes their application in such burgeoning technological fields as fluorescence-based medical imaging and organic light-emitting diodes (<abbr>OLEDs</abbr>). The discovery of organic molecules with large Stokes shifts promises to surmount the challenge and broaden the field of candidates for technological application.</p>
      <p>The greatest achievement of my undergraduate journey was elucidating the mechanism for large Stokes shifts in triazolopyridinium and triazoloquinolinium dyes. Collaborating with Drs. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-cousins/" target="_blank">Morgan Cousins</a> and <a href="https://mliptak.w3.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">Matthew Liptak</a>, I conducted computational chemical analysis using the ORCA-implementation of density functional theory. This led to a novel mechanism for large Stokes shifts based on the inversion of aromatic stability upon excitation.</p>
      <p>The project was presented at an annual UVM Student Research Conference (<a href="/research_pages/poster_toptoq.html">poster available here)</a> and included in my undergraduate thesis: <cite>Petrucci, Adam N., "<a href="https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/items/bbbe267b-d072-4a4a-94b4-7db592a564a3" target="_blank">Modeling of Photophysical Phenomena: Anomalies to Kasha's Rule and Conventional Stokes Shifts</a>" (2021). UVM College of Arts and Sciences College Honors Theses. 93.</cite>. Finally, I am most proud of the peer-reviewed publication of my research, <cite>Adam N. Petrucci, Morgan E. Cousins, Matthew D. Liptak, “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04397" target="_blank">Beyond 'Mega': Origin of the 'Giga' Stokes Shifts of Triazolopyrdiniums</a>.” J. Phys. Chem. B, 2022, 126: 6997-7005</cite>.</p>

      <h2>Aggregation-Induced Emissions by the Suppression of Relaxation Pathways</h2>
      <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_sokr.png"/>
      <p>Aggregation-induced emission (<abbr>AIE</abbr>) offers means of preserving photophysical properties in solid or aggregated states. As the converse to ACQ (discussed above), this is particularly relevant to the development of organic OLEDs and sustainable electronics. Moreover, in the photophysics community, ACQ has long been accepted as standard behavior AIE as only a rarity. In consequence, AIE is not only of practical use, but also of great academic interest.</p>
      <p>Investigation of the Suppression of Kasha's Rule (<abbr>SOKR</abbr>) as a photophysical mechanism for AIE inaugurated my undergraduate research career. <a href="https://mliptak.w3.uvm.edu/">Dr. Matthew Liptak</a> and then-graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-cousins/">Morgan Cousins</a> mentored me in the use of absorbance and fluorescence spectrometries, paired with computational experiments, to elucidate photophysical phenomena. The project also implemented nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the photo-induced isomerization of the principal molecul of interest, diphenyl hexatriene.</p>
      <p>The results of this project were presented at the Champlain Area Chemistry Symposium, (<a href="research_pages/poster_dph.html">poster available here</a>) and included in my undergraduate honors thesis: <cite>Petrucci, Adam N., "<a href="https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/items/bbbe267b-d072-4a4a-94b4-7db592a564a3" target="_blank">Modeling of Photophysical Phenomena: Anomalies to Kasha’s Rule and Conventional Stokes Shifts</a>" (2021).

      <h2>Solid-Phase Microextraction for Collection of Sugarcane Emissions</h2>
      <img class="research-graphic" src="/assets/images/graphic_spme.png"/>
      <p>Secondary organic aerosols (<abbr>SOA</abbr>s) significantly alter fluids' optical properties. This has proven a challenge at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<abbr>NASA</abbr>) research and launch sites, which are often situated in isolated areas used for the cultivation of SOA-emitting crops, such as sugar cane. The technique of Solid-phase microextraction (<abbr>SPME</abbr>) was developed to facilitate on-site collection of SOA samples.</p>
      <p>The Organic Aerosol Research Studies (<abbr>OARS</abbr>) Laboratory at the University of Vermont, headed by <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cas/chemistry/profile/giuseppe-joe-petrucci" target="_blank">Dr. Giuseppe Petrucci</a>, specializes in analytic atmospheric chemistry and hosted me as an intern. Under the tutelage of then-graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-harvey-wel/" target="_blank">Rebecca Harvey</a>. I quantified the efficacy of SPME using coupled gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (<abbr>GCMS</abbr>). This served as the culminating project in my membership of Essex High School's STEM Academy and the beginning of my journey in academic research.</p>
      <p>My results contributed to an ACS publication: <cite>Kevin B. Fischer, Clarissa S. Gold, Rebecca M. Harvey, Adam N. Petrucci, Giuseppe A. Petrucci, “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.0c00092" target="_blank">Ozonolysis Chemistry and Phase Behavior of 1-Octen-3-ol-Derived Secondary Organic Aerosols</a>.” ACS Earth Space Chem., 2020, 4(8): 1298-1308</cite>
