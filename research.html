    <h1>Research</h1>
    <header>
        <p>My most recent research interests are in the realm of applied partial differential equations. The transition from particle systems to continuum mechanics via mean-field limits features most prominently. I am also interested in bifurcation analysis, particularly in the behavior of bifurcation points as models transition between variants dominated by different modes. Both projects are part of my graduate work at Michigan State University (MSU).</p>
        <p>Prior to pursuing a doctoral degree, I conducted research in water-sustainability policy as a data scientist and differential algebra as a Masters student in mathematics. The former resulted in a publication. The latter was, unfortunately, left incomplete in the transition from my undergraduate institution, the University of Vermont, to graduate school (UVM).</p>
        <p>The bulk of my undergraduate research was in chemistry, particularly analytic and physical fields. My undergraduate thesis focused on the photophysical mechanisms of organic molecules exhibiting anomalous fluorescence. I also investigated the potential field-use of a novel extraction method for semivolatile aerosols and participated in a project exploring the introduction of machine learning techniques to the curricula of courses in computational chemistry.</p>
