    <h2>My Teaching Principles</h2>
    <p>I design my lectures according to two principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Math is best taught the way it is observed.</strong>
        <p>In practice, one observes an example of a phenomenon, determines the critical features of that phenomenon, then defines the objects necessary to produce those features. I structure my lectures to reproduce this process. Many math texts present information in the reverse order: first definitions, then properties, and finally examples. While this works well for more advanced abstract topics, I find it obscures the motivation and intuition behind key ideas. I still encourage students to engage with textbooks, but this leads to another principle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In-person instruction should add to, rather than repeat, course material.</strong>
        <p>To me, this means presenting material in a manner fundamentally different from textbooks or online resources. The digitization of learning material and development of online education platforms provides instructors the opportunity to expand teaching styles. Reversing the order of presentation is an excellent example. Those students who learn well from textbooks have online access to my courses' textbooks; I try to provide those who struggle with textbooks an alternative approach. Designing lectures with a personalized style also lends itself to another principle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learning math occurs at the individual scale.</strong>
        <p> I strongly believe the greatest deterimant of success in math education is motivation, and not all students have the same motivation. One of my most recent courses included students from nine different majors. Each had their own interests and passions. To appeal to as many students as possible, and invite them into mathematics, I focus on a diversity of content and connection to other fields. For example, in a summer course on matrix algebra, I opened lectures with examples inspired from agriculture, navigation, cryptography, construction, and logistics, to name a few. Of course, designing math problems in such a variety of contexts is innately fun, but it serves a purpose.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    To encapsulate the underlying tone of my teaching: I find math fascinating and enjoyable, and want to share that attitude with my students. I enjoy reverse-engineering familiar math concepts to explain to newcomers, searching for fresh perspectives on those concepts, and fitting math to individuals' particular interests. All are opportunites for personal growth. I learn as much from lecturing as my students, and I hope they graduate my courses sharing my enjoyment of that learning.
